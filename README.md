### Message to My Future Self:

I know you see the projects and challenges in this file as difficult and overwhelming. But when you come back here after a long time, you will realize they are nothing. The struggles I’m facing now, which seem so hard and exhausting, are just the beginning—this is the toughest stage and the hardest step. If it weren't for this step, you'd be where I am now, doing nothing. Because I endured this, you are now living the dream I wish for.

I know you will think these things are simple and easy, not worth complaining about, but once you saw them as something significant. I understand what you’re thinking and what you will say. You might underestimate me because I am you. Don’t ever think you’re better than me, even if that’s true. I created you, and I made my dreams come true for you to live them.

I know that you, who will read this, may think I’m delusional or crazy, but I’m not. I am more aware, and I know you will be a different person with better thoughts. I know I am the best in this time and will still be the best in yours. To make you even better, I’ll let go of the things I love and the fun things to become greater.

I hope you don’t forget yourself and let arrogance take over, forgetting your connections or being boastful about being the best. Yes, you are the best and the most beautiful, but don’t flaunt it. Be like me, knowing you’re the best but not bragging about it.

I pray that I can create a great man like you, and I hope you are successful. If you’re reading this in less than five years and you haven’t passed away, please don’t respond. But if more time has passed, write to me about what you’ve achieved and how your life is. Share your life experiences, and ask Yusuf, who is five years ahead, to tell us.

I love you so much, and I hope you keep growing and remain the best as you are.
